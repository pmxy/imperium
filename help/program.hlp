program

    Allows you to program your ship to navigate along a predefined course,
and optionally execute actions along the way. The course may loop around
at the end, and you can enter a repeat range that a given movement direction
will be repeated to save space.
    The actions must be set up beforehand, and may be shared by multiple
ship programs.
