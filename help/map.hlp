map <sectors>

    Map allows a deity to get a map display of either galactic sectors or
subsectors. If the <sectors> evaluates out to being only one "galactic"
sector (for instance, 10:19,30:39) then the subsector map will be
displayed, in a 10x10 grid. Anything else will cause it to display a map in
which each "sector" displayed will be the normal single-character sector
sector type that is displayed for long-range scans.
