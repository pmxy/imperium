refuel <ship>

    Allows you to transfer fuel from a fuel tank in the cargo area to the
active fuel array. This fuel will be converted to energy by the ship's
engines (up to the maximum amount of energy your engines will support)
at the next update period. Once you use this command to transfer fuel you
may not get it back in fuel tank form, as the tank casing is lost in the
process.
