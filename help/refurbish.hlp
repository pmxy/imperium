refurbish ship <ship>
          item <big item>

    Allows you to bring a ship or a "big" item back up to specs and possibly
improve it's tech level. To refurbish a ship or item the ship or item must be
on the planet's surface, and the planet must have some production of the
appropriate type (hull for ships, usually electronics for other items).
Partial refurbs are possible if there is insufficient production units
available.
