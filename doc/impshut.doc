ImpShut [-s] [-p] [-P] [-l] [-b] -[B]

   ImpShut allows you to shut down the Imperium server in an orderly and
safe fashion. ImpShut sends a shutdown request to the server and then exits.
If there are no clients active, ImpServ will flush the buffers and exit. If
there are active clients, they will be periodically notified that ImpServ
wants to shut down, and ImpServ will exit when they leave.

    The various options allow you to change the request type that ImpShut
will send to the server. The "-s" option is not normally needed, as it is the
default action if no other option is specified. It is listed only so you know
what command value to enter in the is.allow file. The "-p" option allows you
to tell the server that the AC power has gone out and we are operating on
battery power. This will work much like the default "shutdown" request type in
that the server will attempt to shut down any idle clients, and will exit when
the last client is gone. However, this request can be canceled, while a normal
shutdown can not.

    The "-P" option allows you to cancel a previous "-p" request (if the
server is still running). This will NOT restart any clients that have been
killed off, but it WILL prevent any more from being killed and the server
will not exit. Note that if there are no active clients when you issue the
"-p" request that the server will exit almost immediately, and it will be
too late to use the "-P" request.

    The "-l" option allows you to tell the Imperium server that the UPS
battery power is running low, and it should exit right away, if it has not
already done so. This WILL shut the server down on whatever player(s) still
happen to be logged in, and will most likely leave them marked as "logged
in", so you will have to edit them and change their status before they can
play the game again. This option is a last resort and should not be used to
shut down ImpServ in normal situations. This is mainly for use when leaving
the system up even a minute or two longer my cause the data files to
become corrupted.

    The -b option allows you to request that ImpServ go into "backup" mode.
What will happen is that any active players will be notified that you wish
to do a system backup, and when they log out no new players will be allowed
in until the backup is finished. ImpServ will NOT shut down. IMPORTANT: Unlike
the other options, this command will NOT return until the last player has
exited the game. When you return from this command it will either indicate an
error condition (exit code of 5) or that you may now start backing up files
(exit code of 0).

    The -B option tells ImpServ that you are done doing backups and that it
may start allowing players to log in once more.

    Note that you may only specify ONE of the above options, and that the
"-l" option takes precedence over the others. (IE, doing a "-l" will cause
ImpServ to terminate any "-b" condition that may exist).

*** Be sure to read the file "security.doc" for information on setting up
    the is.allow file properly!
