    In Imperium there are many things which are generically called "items".
These are usually broken down into two classes; "big" items such as engines
or weapons, and "small" items such as people or gold bars.

    Most items are considered "small", and do not have the level of detail of
larger items such as engines or weapons. These items are not identified by a
unique number per item, but by how many of them are present, such as "10
civilians". These items do not have separate technology levels, but are all the
same level.


                             SMALL ITEMS
Civilians

    Civilians are the basic workers and population. They are assumed to have
basic skills, but can not pilot ships, make technical discoveries, or do much
of anything else besides work and reproduce. Based on the amount of production
put into a planets educational system, they may however become scientists.

    Civilians reproduce fastest when the planet population is between 1/3rd and
2/3rds of the maximum. Their growth can also be increased by devoting some
planet production to "civilians".

Scientists

     Scientists are civilians that have completed more advanced schooling,
can work to develop new technology, and can pilot ships if needed. They will
not fire weapons however. In all other respects they are the same as civilians,
and will reproduce more civilians. To increase the create scientists you must
devote some of the planets production to "scientists".

Military

     Military represent the common soldier. They may fire guns and use weapons,
but they can not pilot a ship. They are used to defend planets and ships from
attack by other players. Military do not reproduce. They must be enlisted by
devoting some of the planets production. This will cause your planet to spend
more money promoting the benefits of the military way of life, hopefully
enticing civilians to sign up (scientists will never sign up). You must have
at least 1 officer present to oversee the training.

Officers

     Officers are military that have completed more advanced training, and have
a higher intelligence than the basic military. They can pilot ships, fire
weapons, and will improve the defensive capabilities of whatever they are on
(planet or ship) when compared to basic "military". Officers do not reproduce,
they must come from promoted military. You must have at least 1 officer present
to oversee the training of the rank and file military. Note that the pay for
officers is TWICE that of normal military. Be careful of having too many!

Missiles

     These are used for planet->ship combat, as well as photon torpedoes for
ships.

Ore

     Ore is used to create "production" on planets. Ore is mined from the
planets "mineral" content, and a planet having a higher mineral content will
produce more ore in the same amount of time as a planet with a lower mineral
content.

Gold bars

     Gold bars are produced by mining the planets "gold" content. Unlike ore,
mining gold DOES deplete the resource from the planet, so a planet with a
higher gold content will produce more gold bars before going dry rather than
producing them quicker. Gold bars are VERY important. They are a continual
source of income, for the duration of the game. One of your first priorities
should be mining some gold bars to give you a positive cash flow.

Air tanks

     Air tanks are carried by ships to temporarily offset the loss of their
life support systems. Planets must have an atmosphere above 40% to produce air
tanks.

Fuel tanks

     Fuel tanks are used to store fuel for ships, and represent a pre-packaged
amount of fuel in a combustible, non-reusable container. Each tank holds 75
units of fuel, and once put into the ships' active fuel array can not be
unloaded. Fuel tanks MAY be carried by the ship as cargo, and unloaded if they
are not used for fuel by the ship. Fuel tanks require a planet to have an
atmosphere above 50%, as well as water above 25%, along with "ore"  for use in
the production of the fuel tank containers.

                               BIG ITEMS

    Big items are not usually referenced by quantity, but rather a separate
unit number for each. Big items also hold more information than small items,
such as their tech level, location, etc.

    All big items of a certain type are considered to be the same size, but
their weight will vary depending on the tech level of the planet they are built
on.

Engines

    Engines provide the power for ships, as well as the ability to move between
the stars.

Computers

    Computers control almost every aspect of a ship. It is impossible for a
ship to operate without them. The more computers installed in a ship, the
better range you will get out of the sensors, the more accurate your weapons
will be, and teleports will be more reliable.

Weapons

    There are several types of weapons available, including hybrid of a
blaster and a laser, called a "blaser", and photon torpedoes.

    Blasers:      Blasers do less damage than photon torpedoes, but as they are
                  guided by the ships computer to their target and they travel
                  at the speed of light, they are much more accurate. Blasers
                  take their energy from the ship itself, and so they drain the
                  ships energy banks, and if used too much they may make it
                  impossible to leave the sector until the energy banks
                  recharge.

Photon torpedoes: Photon torpedoes do more damage than blasers, but because
                  they travel slower than light, and occupy physical space,
                  they are less accurate. They require an explosive charge,
                  which must be carried by the starship, and which may explode
                  if the starship takes enough damage. But they can usually
                  destroy an enemy ship with one or two shots (if the ship
                  has no armor), so they have some value.
                  Photon torpedoes are also the only weapon that may be used
                  planet->ship and ship->planet combat.

Sensors

     Sensors allow ships and planets to map out subsectors, and if their
technology level is high enough, to map out sectors as well. Sensors are also
used to scan for ships in the area, and the higher the tech level, the more
likely they are to pick up smaller ships farther away.

Teleports

     Teleports allow a ship transport goods from ship to ship or ship to
surface with other ships or planets in the same subsector. The higher the tech
factor the larger the item that can be transported, and the more reliably the
transfer will occur. For teleports, "larger" means the individual item size,
not necessarily the gross item size. For instance, 1 person is considered
"larger" than 1 ton of ore, since 1 ton of ore consists of a homogeneous mix
of smaller ore pieces. It won't hurt anything if the teleports fuse a few
pieces of the ore together, but you wouldn't want that for living things,
thus teleporting people is only possible on higher-tech teleport systems.
Teleports also depend on computers being operational.

Shields

    Shields provide a non-ablative (well, you are trading energy use for
armor use) defense for the ship. The number and tech level of the shield units
you have installed will determine how much energy you may put into the shields
at any one time.
