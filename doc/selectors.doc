                      -= Querry Selectors =-


Most commands requiring a planet number or a ship number as parameter 
can accept a selector to narrow the request a subset of the players 
planets or ships, based on a specific "condition".

The syntax of the selector is ?[KEYWORD][OPERATOR][VALUE]

For example :

    census geo ?ore>50

will list all your planets with an ore deposit > 50.


KEYWORD represents one of the various information returned by the census and
ship commands, like "civ" or "gold", and are described in this document.
KEYWORD can be abreviated to its first letters, as long there is 
no ambiguity.
If too few letters are given to distinguish betwen KEYWORDS, an error message 
is displayed.


OPERATOR is :
    =   : is equal 
    #   : is different
    >   : is strictly superior
    <   : is strictly inferior


VALUE is the comparison reference. 
<REVIEW one letter value don't work ? pmx-2022.04.29>

<REVIEW '&' operator doesn't work ? pmx-2022.04.29>
Selectors can be chained with the & operator. For example :

    census geo ?ore>50 & ?efficiency>60

will list all your planets with an ore deposit > 50 and efficency > 60.

As a special case, ?class=x can be abbreviated with /x. For example :
        census geo /1

will display the geology census for your Home Planet.

KEYWORD and VALUE can be exchanged, case, remember that the < and > relations
are also reversed |

    census geo ?ore>50 is identical to census geo ?50<ore
