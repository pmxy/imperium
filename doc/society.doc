Each planet and ship have a technology level. The level is 0 when the universe
is created, and can be increased by players owning the planet. Basically
you must devote some of the planets production to ore, and some to technology
development. The planet will produce ore, which is then used to create
technology production units, which are then used to increase the planets
technology level. Also, every time a planet is updated the technology level
is reduced by 1%. This means you must continue to devote at least part of the
planet's production to technology development to prevent backsliding.

The technology level for a ship is set by the technology level of the planet
it's composite parts are built on, and also decreases at a certain
rate per update period. Ships can have their technology level brought back
up by landing them on a planet and using the "refurbish" command.

The technology level is used to generate the "technology factor", which is
itself used to scale various things like weapon range, ship speed, etc.
A technology level of 0 will yield a technology FACTOR of .15, and the
technology factor can go to slightly over 1.0, in very very rare cases.
This means that there can be almost a factor of 7 in the quality of goods
produced by a low-tech planet and a high-tech planet.

Only planet's have a research level, which is similar to their technology
level, but represents that planets degree of medical and environmental
knowledge and skill. This is also lowered by 1% each time the planet
is updated. The research level mainly affects the planet's likelihood of
catching the plague, but can also influence many other subtle actions.

In Imperium, plague represents all aspects of disease resulting from poor
living conditions, hasty industrialization, improper lack of concern for the
environment, and the just plain random mutagenic effects on cells of gamma
wave radiation present everywhere. Plague is always fatal once it develops,
but it is possible to limit it's spread fairly easily if you are careful.

Whenever a planet is updated, Imperium calculates a "plague factor", or
the 0-100 odds of that planet coming down with the plague. This can be
increased by having a high technology level with a lower research level,
excess ore lying around unused, a high pollution index, or a population in
excess of the recommended population for that size planet. This can
be decreased by having more scientists on the planet, by having a higher
research level, reducing the pollution index, or a high planet efficiency.

The plague has 3 stages. The lengths of each of the stages in random, and the
length of one stage has no relation to the length of any other. In the first
stage the plague is dormant, and there are no symptoms. When this stage is
over the planet becomes infectious, and you will receive a telegram or message
to warn you (a news item will also be generated). While the plague is in stage
2 or 3, any movement off of the planet - whether by loading a ship,
teleporters, etc. will infect the ship that the items are moved onto. The 3rd
stage is when people begin dying. The number that die can be reduced if the
planet is efficient, as stated above.

It is possible to "checkpoint" planets in Imperium. This allows the owner of
a planet to assign a "password" to a planet that will allow other players
access to the planet if they know the code. If the planet does not have a
checkpoint other players will not be allowed to land ships on the planet
or load up items on the planet.

Be careful when loading or unloading items from a planet you do not own.
If it is infected your ship will get the plague. Likewise, allowing other
players to land and unload items on your planets may cause YOU to get the
plague if their ships are infected.
