How to install Imperium:

1)	Run the "configure" script. You may need to do "sh configure" to start
	it up on your system.

2)	Run "make" in this directory (the top level of the Imperium source
	distribution).

3)	If everything seems to build OK, run "make install". Note that you may
	need to be root to do this, depending on where you are installing
	Imperium.

4)	If you have trouble installing Imperium on your machine, let me know.
	I only have access to Ubuntu & Mac machines, so I can't test it much
	beyond those environments...

5)	Read the following files in the "Doc" subdirectory before creating any
	worlds for other people to play:
	hosting.doc, deity.doc, impcre.doc
