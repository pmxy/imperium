1)	Reduce the rate at which you earn cash from planets. It allows you
	to earn way too much money currently.
2)	Complete combat code.
	a) When planets defend, should it be handled just like ships?
3)	Add some additional type of security to the ImpServ->utilities layer.
	Need to be able to prevent "normal" users from being able to access the
	ImpShut features by writing their own clients. Maybe use a handshake
	sequence when a client starts up to determine if they are a "powerfull"
	user or not. Even better would be to provide extra server calls that
	allowed you to make three successive "challenge" server requests to
	activate the ImpShut/ImpCre features.
4)	Need to add ability to edit the weapons installed on planets
5)	Need to add edit/examine routines for big items.
6)	Add sdump command to dump all ship data
7)	Fix Makefiles to check rebuilding of executable targets if outdated
