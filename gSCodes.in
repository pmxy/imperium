Imperium uses "secret" codes (they are never displayed or entered) to
prevent users from "spoofing" the Imperium server into doing things it
would not normally allow them to do. The codes will be encrypted, if
possible, and the server will look at the (possibly) encrypted codes and
decide if the client is "known" before responding to it.

For this to work I must create a file called "impsec.h" which will
contain the codes that you wish to use. Note that only the first 8
characters will be used for each code.
