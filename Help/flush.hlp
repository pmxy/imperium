flush

    Allows you to flush all the items that the Imperium server has in it's
cache to disk right away. The deity may choose to prevent normal users
from executing this command.
    You can use this command to assure yourself that any "moves" you have
made will not be lost should the host computer die before writing them to
disk. Normally the clients will be set to flush the buffers every time a
player logs out, so this command will not normally be needed.
