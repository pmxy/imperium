navigate <ships> [<directions>]

    Navigate allows you to manually move ships throughout the galaxy. The
ships must all be at least 60% efficient, may not be on the surface of a
planet, and must have enough energy in their energy banks for the movement
commands you give.
    If they are on the surface of a planet you must use the liftoff command to
get them into orbit before moving them.
