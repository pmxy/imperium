    "Change name" allows you to change your name. The deity may not allow you
to use this command. You will be asked for your password to verify your
identity.

    "Change password" allows you to change your password. You will be asked
for your current password to verify your identity.

    "Change email address" allows you to change your email address.
You will be asked for your password to verify your identity.

    "Change send email" allows you to set whether various email should be sent

    "Change player" will let you "become" another active player. The deity
may not allow you to use this command. You will need to know the password
for the player you wish to become.

    "Change notify" will allow you to change the way Imperium notifies you
of events that occur, usually by another players actions against you. There
are 3 ways you can be notified. The default is "message", which means you
will get a real-time message if you are online and the event occurs. If you
are not online when the event occurs you will receive a telegram. The option
"telegram" will cause you to ALWAYS receive a telegram, IE: you will get
a "You have new telegrams" message at the next "command" prompt, which you
must then use the "read" command to see. The last option, "both", will cause
you to receive both messages AND telegrams for each event.

    "Change compressed" allows you to toggle the default compressed mode for
sensor reports. The current status is listed with the "status" command.

    "Change fe" allows you to toggle the FE support mode. Normally this
is enabled automatically by your front end (FE). The current status is listed
with the "status" command.

    "Change width" allows you to change the desired width of your screen.
Imperium does not use this itself, but rather this information is provided
for support of multiple window FE's or word-wrapping clients.

    "Change length" allows you to change the desired length or "height" of
your screen (number of lines). Imperium uses this to provide "paging" of
"help" and "doc" files, and it may be used by special clients.
