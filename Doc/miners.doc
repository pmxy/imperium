                        Imperium - Miners


Purpose:
    Some planets are incapable of supporting life due to an atmosphere that is
too thin or having no atmosphere at all. If you unload people onto the surface
of one of these planets, they will die as soon as the air they carry on their
back runs out (1 ITU) unless they are transferred onto another ship. This does
not mean you can't extract minerals from these planets, however.
    There is a special class of ship known as a "miner" that can do this for
you, without any crew on board at all. Miners can be loaded into the hold of
other ships (if they have enough free cargo space), and then dropped onto the
surface of an inhospitable planet to mine whatever minerals they can and then
radio you of their progress.

Creation:
    Miners are built on a planet just like any other class of ship. In a
"standard" universe they will cost 275 production units (plus the standard
"monetary" cost per unit), and can carry 3000 units of ore/bars. Note that
the ship you start out with does NOT have enough cargo space to carry a
miner, while the largest hull could carry several.

Use:
    A miner is first loaded into the cargo hold of another ship via the
"load miner" command. Both the miner and the ship must be on the same
planet, and miners can not be transferred between ships directly. They must
first be unloaded from one ship and then loaded onto the other.
    Once the miner is loaded you may use the "miner refuel" command to
transfer some of the ship's active field energy (not it's "fuel", you are
charging a field coil in the miner directly. The miner has no way to
convert raw "fuel" into energy) to the miner. (If you forget this step you
won't see much work :-).
    Before dropping the miner off you way wish to use the "miner program"
command to change how the miner will operate. This can only be done while
the miners' umbillacle is still attached to the mother ship's cargo hold.
Once you arrive and have landed on the target planet you may use the
"unload miner" command to place it on the surface and it will begin it's
work. You may either stay on the surface and wait for it, or leave and
come back when it's cargo hold is full. Note however that your presence on
the planet's surface is much more noticeable then a small miner...
    When the miners hold is full you can use the "load miner" command to
place it in the cargo hold of your ship (you can load it at any time,
if you need to clear out of the area in a hurry, say) and then use the
"miner empty" command to transfer any ore or gold bars to your ship's
cargo hold.
    To make all your miners actually do their work you need to use the
"miner update" command. Note that this may NOT be required if the deity
has set up Imperium so that miners get updated on their own. Check with
them and see if this is the case.
    At any time you may use the "miner list" command to display one or more
of your miners, and their current status.

Programming:
    There are three items you can set on a miner, and each items can be
one of four "levels". The items are "ore", "messages", and "gold". The
"levels" are "none", "low", "medium", and "high".
    For "ore" and "gold" the levels represent the amount of energy that
should be used to attempt to mine the respective mineral. The levels compete
against each other, such that setting both to "low" will result in equal
low-level production, but setting "ore" to "medium" with "gold" to "low"
will result in more energy going to ore production at the cost of gold
production. If a planet is very low in either gold or ore, you may set
the appropriate item to "none" and the miner will not waste any energy
trying to mine that mineral.
    The "messages" item indicates how verbose the miner should be about
notifying you of it's progress. The higher this level, the more
messages you will get (either as on-line messages, or as telegrams if
you are not logged in when the miner is updated). The higher the message
level, the greater the chances that someone else will discover your miner.
